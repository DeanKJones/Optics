## Introduction

This project provides a WebGPU-based simulation environment for visualizing wave optics phenomena, including diffraction patterns and interference effects. 
The goal is to have simulations that are based on solving Maxwell's equations using FDTD methods. With the hope of moving onto rendering several orbitals along with the EM field.


## Features

- **Diffraction Grating Simulation**: Visualize the interference pattern behind a set diffraction grid.
