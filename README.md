# Wave Optics

This project is inspired by 3Blue1Brown's video on holograms and aims to simulate the interference pattern behind diffraction grid. The goal is to expand on this and implement Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations and spectral rendering to learn wave optics and Maxwell's equations.
